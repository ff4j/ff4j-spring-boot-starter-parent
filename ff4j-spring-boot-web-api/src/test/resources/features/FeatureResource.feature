@FeatureResource

Feature: This feature enables in providing the user with RESTful api's where in the user is able to access the information
  of a feature by its unique identification and be able to modify the behavior of the feature config. The user should be
  able to do the following:
  - Read configuration information about the feature
  - Update the configuration of the feature
  - Delete a feature
  - Enable or disable a feature
  - Grant or remove a role to\from a feature
  - Add or remove a feature to\from a group

  Background:
    Given the feature store is cleared

  # Read configuration information about the feature
  Scenario: When the feature does not exists in the feature store and when the user wants to read its feature configuration by its uid, we get an exception
    When the user requests for a feature by "/api/ff4j/store/features/login" by "GET" http method and content type as "application/json"
    Then the user gets an error response with code "404" and error message as "feature not found"

  Scenario Outline: Read configuration information about the feature
    Given the feature with <uid>, <enabled>, <description>, <group> and <permissions> exists in the feature store
    When the user requests for a feature by "/api/ff4j/store/features/" appended with <requestUID> by "GET" http method and content type as "application/json"
    Then the user gets the response with response code as <responseCode> and content as <expectedUid>, <expectedEnabled>, <expectedDescription>, <expectedGroup> and <expectedPermissions>
    Examples:
      | uid     | enabled | description                          | group   | permissions             | requestUID | responseCode | expectedUid | expectedEnabled | expectedDescription                  | expectedGroup | expectedPermissions     |
      | "login" | "TRUE"  | "feature for showing the login page" | "users" | "ROLE_USERS,ROLE_ADMIN" | "login"    | 200          | "login"     | "TRUE"          | "feature for showing the login page" | "users"       | "ROLE_USERS,ROLE_ADMIN" |
      | "admin" | "FALSE" | "feature for showing the admin page" | "admin" | "ROLE_ADMIN"            | "admin"    | 200          | "admin"     | "FALSE"         | "feature for showing the admin page" | "admin"       | "ROLE_ADMIN"            |

  # Update the configuration of the feature
  Scenario: When the feature uid is blank or empty and the user tries to create or update the configuration, the user gets an exception
    When the user requests for a feature by "/api/ff4j/store/features/login" by "PUT" http method and content type as "application/json"
    And request body as

    Then the user gets an error response with code "400" and error message as "feature uid cannot be blank"
