@FeatureServices

Feature: FeatureServices
  This feature enables in providing the user with api's where in the user is able to access the information
  of a feature by its unique identification and be able to modify the behavior of the feature config. The user should be
  able to do the following:
  - Read configuration information about the feature
  - Update the configuration of the feature
  - Delete a feature
  - Enable or disable a feature
  - Grant or remove a role to\from a feature
  - Add or remove a feature to\from a group

  Background:
    Given the feature store is cleared

  # Read configuration information about the feature
  Scenario: When the feature does not exists in the feature store and when the user wants to read its feature configuration by its uid, we get an exception
    When the user requests for a feature by feature id as "login"
    Then the user gets an exception "org.ff4j.services.exceptions.FeatureNotFoundException"

  Scenario Outline: Read configuration information about the feature
    Given the feature with <uid>, <enabled>, <description>, <group> and <permissions> exists in the feature store
    When the user requests for a feature by feature id as <requestUID>
    Then the user gets the response as <expectedUid>, <expectedEnabled>, <expectedDescription>, <expectedGroup> and <expectedPermissions>
    Examples:
      | uid     | enabled | description                          | group   | permissions             | requestUID | expectedUid | expectedEnabled | expectedDescription                  | expectedGroup | expectedPermissions     |
      | "login" | "true"  | "feature for showing the login page" | "users" | "ROLE_USERS,ROLE_ADMIN" | "login"    | "login"     | "true"          | "feature for showing the login page" | "users"       | "ROLE_USERS,ROLE_ADMIN" |
      | "admin" | "false" | "feature for showing the admin page" | "admin" | "ROLE_ADMIN"            | "admin"    | "admin"     | "false"         | "feature for showing the admin page" | "admin"       | "ROLE_ADMIN"            |

  # Update the configuration of the feature
  Scenario: When the feature uid is blank or empty and the user tries to create or update the configuration, the user gets an exception
    When the user requests to create or update a feature with feature id as "" and feature spec as

    {
      "enable" : true
    }

    Then the user gets an exception "org.ff4j.services.exceptions.FeatureIdBlankException"

  Scenario: When the feature uid is valid and does not match with the feature we are trying to update and when the user tries to create or update the configuration, we get an exception
    When the user requests to create or update a feature with feature id as "login" and feature spec as
